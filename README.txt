Garrick's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Garrick and I'm an aspiring climate scientist, currently working on building the skills necessary to land my first job as an analyst. Eventually, I hope to work my way up to becoming a full-fledged climate scientist.

In this repository, you'll find examples of some of the projects I've been working on, along with the code and data used to complete them. My goal with this portfolio is to showcase my skills as a data analyst and data scientist, as well as my ability to effectively communicate my findings.

If you have any questions or would like to connect with me, please feel free to send me an email or message me on LinkedIn. I'm always looking for new opportunities and collaborations.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio!
